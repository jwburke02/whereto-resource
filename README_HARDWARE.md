# Hardware Report
## Backend Requirements
WhereTo can theoretically be hosted on any device which is capable of running both Python3.8 and PyTorch. The difference will be in how fast WhereTo is able to perform its computations. WhereTo does require around 50GB of disk size. The reason for this is that it, including its dependencies, takes up a lot of storage space. Additionally, internet is required to use WhereTo.
## Frontend Requirements
In order to run the frontend of WhereTo, it is hosted on a computer. This computer must be capable of running a React Native JS application using npm as the package manager. The phone running WhereTo must be capable of running the Expo Go application in either the iOS or Android app stores. This is the applicaiton used to test WhereTo. Additionally, the phone must be connected to the internet in order to use WhereTo.
## Cloud Hosting Backend
When hosting WhereTo on the cloud, there are a few things that must be considered. The first is that Google Cloud hardware is reccomended. The reason is that it will make it easier to integrate with the Google APIs in use by WhereTo. Additionally, it will keep all of the billing and console management with one provider, Google. When provisioning a machine for hosting WhereTo, remember to have at least 50GB of storage space provisioned. This is because of the dependencies of WhereTo. Additionally, grant HTTP/HTTPS access to the ports required, and allow for your machine to access the Cloud Vision API.
